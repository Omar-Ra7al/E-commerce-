### ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Web Application (Vanilla JS)
I developed a fully functional and responsive e-commerce platform from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript, avoiding any JavaScript or CSS frameworks. This application is designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience for users and includes:

- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and account creation processes.
- **Product Management:** A detailed admin dashboard that allows administrators to efficiently manage the product catalog, including adding new products, removing existing ones, and controlling product visibility on the storefront.
- **Responsive Design:** The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Advanced Features:** Additional functionalities such as password updates, image management, and more, provide both users and admins with a comprehensive toolset.

This project showcases my ability to build robust web applications with a focus on performance, usability, and maintainability.
